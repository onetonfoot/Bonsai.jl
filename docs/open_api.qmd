# OpenAPI 

An open api spec can be generated for a `App` which can be used with tools like [Swagger UI](https://swagger.io/tools/swagger-ui/), to generate documentation.

```julia
open_api = OpenApi(app)
JSON3.write("open-api.json", open_api)
```

[JET](https://github.com/aviatesk/JET.jl) is used to analyze the code and detects all of the `Bonsai.read` and `Bonsai.write` calls, this information is then used to create the spec. This feature is currently very alpha and needs work before it's robust.
