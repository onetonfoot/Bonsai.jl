# OpenAPI 

An open api spec can be generated for your `App`, [JET](https://github.com/aviatesk/JET.jl) is used to analyze the code and detects all of the `Bonsai.read` and `Bonsai.write` calls, this information is then used to create the spec. This feature is currently still alpha and needs some more work before it's robust.

```julia
open_api = OpenApi(app)
JSON3.write("open-api.json", open_api)
```

# Docs

To add a web page for you documentation you can call

```
openapi!(app)
```

This will add to endpoints:

* `docs/` - A web page containing documentation for for API built using [SwaagerUI](https://swagger.io/tools/swagger-ui/)
* `docs/open-api.json` - The open API specifcation


# Client Generation

You can generate clients from a number of tools from open specs, for example to generate a typescript client you coult run


```
npx openapi-typescript-codegen --input open-api.json --output client
```
