# Open API Generation

An open API spec can be generated for your `App`, [JET](https://github.com/aviatesk/JET.jl) is used to analyze the code and detects all of the `Bonsai.read` and `Bonsai.write` calls, this information is then used to create the spec. This feature is currently still alpha and needs some more work before it's robust.

```julia
open_api = OpenApi(app)
JSON3.write("open-api.json", open_api)
```

To add a web page for your documentation you can call

```julia
openapi!(app)
```

This will add the endpoints:

* `docs/` - A web page containing documentation for API built using [SwaggerUI](https://swagger.io/tools/swagger-ui/)
* `docs/open-api.json` - The open API specifcation


# Client Generation

You can generate clients using a number of tools from open-api specs, for example, to generate a typescript client you could run

```
npx openapi-typescript-codegen --input open-api.json --output client
```
